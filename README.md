# LWTools

This repository is the home of my Lightwave 3D python plugins and other tools and toys I am developing to better (re)integrate Lightwave into a greatly expanded toolchain and workflow.    

Two new files added on Sept 10, 2023: 

tabbys_surface_saver_02.py
  saves the selected surface to the chosen directory and filename instead of defaulting to plugin location and surface.txt
  loader should be ready in a day or two if I have time tomorrow to fix one thing in it.  Like how to spawn a "file selection" dialog
  instead of a "directory selection" dialog.   Python docs here really are an adventure.  <grin>

surfacing_logic_flow_001.py
  this is just a comment block that's an 'stream of consciousness' attempt to get the logic flow for how to parse surface names, image names
  user selections and a few other bits of logic that I want to implement in this.   Expect this file to grow and change over time.  And I really
  really, really miss my translucent green 1970s era IBM programming logic flow templates.  May have to hit ebay to dig one up.
